/**
 * Asadmin Command for scaling down the number of instances within a {@link DeploymentGroup Deployment Group} using its
 * configured {@link ScalingGroup Scaling Group}.
 *
 * Instead of looking up the target {@link DeploymentGroup Deployment Group} directly and then using that to grab the
 * {@link ScalingGroup Scaling Group} config, we search through the {@link ScalingGroups Scaling Groups} for a
 * {@link ScalingGroup Scaling Group} that is linked to the target {@link DeploymentGroup Deployment Group}. This is
 * done since the {@link DeploymentGroup Deployment Group} doesn't hold a reference to the
 * {@link ScalingGroup Scaling Group} so as to allow the Core Server to not depend on the AutoScale Groups plugin.
